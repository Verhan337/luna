# Luna: Standalone AI Virtual Assistant

Luna is a fully standalone, modular, and extensible AI-powered virtual assistant that runs entirely on your machine. Luna can interact with your PC, phone, bank accounts, crypto wallets, and moreâ€”with your explicit consent. All sensitive credentials are stored securely in an encrypted local vault, and all sensitive actions are logged for your review.

## Features
- Offline speech recognition (Vosk)
- Offline speech synthesis (pyttsx3)
- Local LLM for intent parsing (HuggingFace Transformers)
- Modular skill system (PC, phone, banking, crypto, web, smart home, scheduler, etc.)
- Secure vault for credentials (encrypted, local)
- Explicit user consent for all sensitive actions
- Audit log for all sensitive actions
- Android phone integration via ADB
- GUI (Tkinter) and CLI interfaces
- Desktop notifications
- Security/authentication
- Extensible plugin system

## Secure Vault, Consent, and Audit
- **Vault:** All credentials (bank, crypto, etc.) are stored encrypted using your master password. Only decrypted in memory when needed.
- **Consent:** Luna will always ask for your explicit consent before using your sensitive info (bank, crypto, etc.).
- **Audit:** All sensitive actions are logged in an encrypted audit log for your review.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Download a Vosk model and place it in a `models` directory (see Vosk docs).
3. (Optional) Download a HuggingFace model for local intent parsing.
4. Run Luna:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Adding Skills
- Add new Python modules in the `skills/` directory.
- Register them in `plugin_loader.py`.

## Configuration
- Edit `config.py` for device and user settings.

## Security
- Authentication, permissions, vault, and audit are managed in the `security/` directory.
